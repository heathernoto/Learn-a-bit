# Learn-A-Bit

## From the Mintbean Learn-A-Bit Series...

As the name says, the purpose of Learn-a-bit is about learning one bit of code at a time. In these events, you will build small projects to educate yourself on the fundamentals of web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These events are relaxed and non-competitive, but are still challenging enough to push you to use all your resources and knowledge to solve each problem.
